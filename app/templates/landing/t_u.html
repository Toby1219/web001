                <p class="scope-paragraph">The trader’s annual return will be optimised by conducting simulations with real historical Bitstamp trading data. The trader will only sell bitcoins if profit can be made. By having the strategy to only sell with profit we have made the assumption that Bitcoin will have an increasing price in the long-term. Because of this the trader can wait until the pockets with Bitcoin that have already been purchased can be sold again with profit. This means that in a prolonged monotonous bear market no return can be achieved in the worst case situation. The trader’s return is very dependent on the market. If the Bitcoin’s price fluctuates considerably, the Client will achieve the best return with the trader. Past return on investment is no guarantee for the future. Investment in Bitcoin is regarded by many people as high-risk and that also applies therefore to using the cryptotraders. Therefore never invest more than you can afford to lose.</p>

Trusted Minner will never be liable for the loss of money or Bitcoins due to problems with Bitcoin or the Bitcoin network or the decrease in value of Bitcoin. Trusted Minner will never be liable for indirect loss, including in any event consequential loss, lost profit, lost savings, loss due to business interruption, or intangible loss on the part of the Client. Trusted Minner will not be liable for damage, of whatsoever nature, due to the fact that Trusted Minner has proceeded from inaccurate and/or incomplete data provided by the Client, unless this inaccuracy or incompleteness ought to be apparent to Trusted Minner. The limitations of liability included in this article do not apply if the damage can be attributed to intention or gross negligence on the part of Trusted Minner or its managerial employees. If Trusted Minner were to be liable for any damage whatsoever, the liability on the part of Trusted Minner will be limited to a maximum amount of $ 7,500 or to the amount that the insurance taken out by Trusted Minner gives entitlement to, plus the amount of the deductible which is not borne by the insurer under the policy conditions that Trusted Minner accordingly must bear. The client must report the damage, for which Trusted Minner can be held liable, as soon as possible but in any event within 10 days from the arising of the damage, to Trusted Minner, all this at the risk of forfeiting any right to compensation of this damage. Any action for liability against Trusted Minner lapses within one year after the Client became aware of the damage causing fact or could reasonably have become aware thereof.</p>
